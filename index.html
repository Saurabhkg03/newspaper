        <h4>Unleashing the Power of TensorFlow</h4>
        <div class="multi-column">
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">By Saurabh K. Gaikwad</span><p>This blog written by me on medium.com explores the capabilities of TensorFlow,
             a popular framework for deep learning.
             It discusses how TensorFlow enhances deep learning in computer vision and neural vision tasks,
             highlighting its flexible architecture, high-level APIs, pre-trained models, efficient GPU computation, and features like Neural Structured Learning. The blog also provides code examples for implementing image
              classification using feed-forward neural networks (FFNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) with TensorFlow's Keras API.</p>

        <p>Everybody loves pasta. It's impossible to not love them, so here are 15 recipes, served with GSAP. Note the
          easter egg â€” the menu icon changes according to the pasta that you choose.</p>

        <p>A tribute of sorts to an era of cool superhero movies, this is a Marvel-themed magazine! Recommended, because
          it took 45 hours, so you know some serious dedication has been poured into this.</p>

          collection. Inspired by the <em>Atomic Design</em> principle, this 8-pen collection includes a 404 page
          concept, an admin dashboard and what a Twitter user calls a 'media card zen garden'. Each pen comes with five
          (yes, five) color themes, including the precious dark mode.</p>

              unbiased opinion, are <a href="https://codepen.io/oliviale/full/wbyVWr" target="_blank">the recreation of
                the Pac-Man layout</a> and <a href="https://codepen.io/oliviale/pen/wbyVWr" target="_blank">coupons

              cultured person, you will have a chance to enjoy a couple of pens inspired by <a
